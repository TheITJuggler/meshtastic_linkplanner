# Meshtastic Link Planner 

## About

This is a web utility to predict the range of a Meshtastic radio (see meshtastic.org). It generates a map of where your meshtastic radio can be received based on your location and antenna height.

*To use, go to the hosted version here*: 

The prediction accounts for terrain and calculates the expected RSSI (received signal strength indication) using the ITM / Longely-Rice model. The model parameters have been chosen based on experimental data to produce results which are accuate for meshtastic devices. Radio parameters are based on the selected LoRa region.
